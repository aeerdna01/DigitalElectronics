# DigitalElectronics ALU-v4

The module presented in the documentation, described by the following specifications, will be implemented in FPGA using VHDL language and VIVADO program:
- The operands A and B have a size of 8 bits.
- The operations will be determined through the input port OPCODE.
- The arithmetic operations list: *, /, +, -

The results will be assigned to port C and will be displayed through the LEDs on the development board. The description will be made structurally. The resulting bitstream file obtained after the implementation process will be verified using the BASYS3 development board.
